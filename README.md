# Banking System Simulation

## Description

This is a simple banking system simulation that demonstrates how a queue data structure can be used to manage customer requests in a bank. Customers can be added to the queue to perform services like deposit, withdrawal, and account inquiry. The system processes customers sequentially, serving them in the order they arrive.

## Features

- *Customer Queue*: Customers are added to the queue based on their arrival.
- *Services*: Three types of services are offered:
  1. *Deposit*: Deposit a specified amount of money into the account.
  2. *Withdrawal*: Withdraw a specified amount of money from the account.
  3. *Account Inquiry*: Inquire about account status.
- *Queue Management*: The system serves customers in the order they arrive (FIFO).
- *Data Validation*: Ensures that negative amounts are not allowed for deposits or withdrawals.

## File Structure

- banking_system.c: Contains the main logic for the banking system simulation.
- README.md: This readme file.
